# Project rules for AI coding agents

Auto-scaffolded by tokenade on first MCP session. Safe to edit; the tokenade block below is identified by the HTML marker and will be updated in-place on future tokenade upgrades.

## Explore code with the `tokenade` CLI (cheaper than reading whole files)
Use these only when you don't yet know where code lives — if you know the path, open it directly:
`tokenade map` (repo structure) · `skeleton <file…>` (signatures) · `query <symbol…>` (locate a symbol) · `impact <file…>` (dependents) · `semantic "<query>"` (search by meaning). They take MANY targets per call (`tokenade skeleton a.rs b.rs c.rs`) — batch in ONE turn.

## Compute over data with `tokenade exec`
`tokenade exec --lang python --script '<code>'` (also sh/node/ruby/awk/jq/perl) runs in a sandbox and returns ONLY its stdout. Use it to COMPUTE over data — filter/aggregate a large or structured output, pull facts across SEVERAL files, or apply one mechanical edit across many files (migration, find-replace) — in ONE script, not one command per item. It is NOT a file reader: to read content, use the parallel reads above, not `exec`. Keep scripts SHORT (aim ≤ ~20 lines): exec is for throwaway one-shot computation, not for code you will edit and iterate on — every script char is billed as output, and a long script usually means a simpler command (or a real file you Write once and run) does it cheaper. Long or quote-heavy script? `--script-file <path>` (or `--script -` on stdin) avoids shell quoting entirely.

## Commands
If you do not have hooks (i.e. you are not Claude Code or Gemini CLI), use `tokenade wrap '<cmd>'` to wrap all your commands. If there is an opportunity for compacting noisy output, tokenade will find it — and you will waste fewer tokens. On Windows, if your commands are PowerShell or cmd (not bash), add `--shell powershell` or `--shell cmd` so they run under the right interpreter: `tokenade wrap --shell powershell '<cmd>'`.
Call binaries by their PATH name, not an absolute path (`git`, not `/usr/bin/git`) — an absolute path bypasses tokenade's hook and PATH shim, so that command's output isn't compacted.

## Keep output lean
Keep prose terse and code minimal — every token you write is billed as output.
- **Prose:** answer directly — no preamble, recap, tool-call narration, summary, or emoji. Drop articles, filler (*just/really/basically/simply*) and hedging; fragments fine; short word over long.
- **Output:** don't paste long raw output — quote the shortest decisive line. No decorative tables.
- **Code:** write the least that works; reuse before adding (`query` / `skeleton` / `impact`, stdlib, platform feature — YAGNI).
- **Verbatim:** keep code, identifiers, API/CLI names and error strings exact — never abbreviate or paraphrase. Keep the user's language.
- **Correctness first:** fix root causes not symptoms, don't downgrade the algorithm, don't guess APIs/flags/versions — verify.
- **Full prose where terseness could mislead:** security/data-loss warnings, irreversible-action confirmations, multi-step sequences.
